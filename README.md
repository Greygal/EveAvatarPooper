# EveAvatarPooper
This script takes an EveOnline character name, and displays their avatar in a circle sized for 2.25" pin-back buttons.  Can print up to 9 per page. This script is used by the Eve Volunteers for charity fundraising at EveOnline meetups and events.  This script was originally coded by Carbon Alabel, who we are eternally grateful to!
