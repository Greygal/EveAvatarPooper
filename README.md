# EveAvatarPooper
This script takes an EveOnline character name, and displays their avatar in a circle sized for 2.25" pin-back buttons.  Can print up to 9 per page.

This script is used by the Eve Volunteers for charity fundraising at EveOnline meetups and events.

To use this script, simply save it as a text file and open it with any browser.  Don't even need to upload it to a webserver!

This script was originally coded by Carbon Alabel, who we are eternally grateful to!
